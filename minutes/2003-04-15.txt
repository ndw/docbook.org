| 5. URI/URN markup[3]

Mike summarized the proposal.

Some discussion of the class values.

Proposal is to add URI to tech.char.class without the class attribute.

Accepted.

ACTION: Mike to post a summary to the list, pointing out that we didn't adopt the
        proposed class attribute.

| 6. Multiple refnamedivs per refentry[4] (related to RFE #514435)

Postpone until Bob's return.

| 7. Task/Topic[5]

NW: Would abstract do? Does it really need to be taskabstract/

SC: TaskAbstract was originally Description, but the team wanted to make sure it
    was very short. So the name was changed to TaskAbstract. We can
    change that name.

NH: What if you wanted pre requesites before each procedure.

SC: Then you might need to restructure.

Discussion of the proposal

TaskSummary?
TaskPrerequisites?
Procedure
Example*
TaskRelated

ACTION: Norm to post a summary of the content models as described.
Plan to accept next month if there's no pushback.

| 8. Bidi proposal[6]

Proposal: Add

   dir (ltr|rtl|lro|rlo) #IMPLIED

as a global attribute.

Accepted.

| 9. Choicelist markup

Postpone until Mike's return.

| 10. Annotations [7]

SC: When I hear 'annotation', I think of technical review comments.

NW: Annotations could be used for that.

DH: This is something HP would definitely use. We'd use it as pop-over or roll-over
    tool tip text, for example.

ACTION: Norm to write some stylesheets to demonstrate how this might
look. Perhaps that will identify failings or at least motivate
additional enthusiasm.

| 11. Inline bibliography elements (related to RFE #679316) [8]

NH: We've already got a huge number of inlines. The thought of adding
a whole bunch of more things is really discouraging.

ACTION: Norm to respond to Bob's message and see if we can get some
email discussion going.

11b. CALS and HTML Tables in DocBook

Proposal: if we adopt the proposal to add HTML tables to DocBook, we
should use Transitional not Strict on the basis that much of the
motivation for doing it is in the attributes available only in
Transional HTML model.

Accepted.

Proposal: adopt Paul's suggested changes to the DTD to allow both CALS
and HTML Transitional tables in DocBook documents.

Does anyone request that we do this by email?

None.

NH: Are we quorate?

Yes.

Steve Cogorno   No
Dick Hamilton   Yes
Paul Grosso     Yes
Nancy Harrison  Yes
Norman Walsh    Yes
Mike Smith      Now absent

Accepted.

Adjourned.
