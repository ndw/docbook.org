|
      436067 splitting tech.char.class 

Waiting for Norm to complete action about PE reorg.

|      473365 Allow optional in funcprototype 

No followup from original poster. Norm notes that allowing them to be
optional would be useful for modern programming languages like Perl
and Python that allow optional parameters.

Accept proposal outlined in 473365.

Accepted.

|      482818 Simplify ToC content model 

Waiting for Norm to complete action.

|      514435 Allow reference within refentry 

The real issue here seems to be the ability to associate purposes with
components in refentrys.

ACTION: Bob to post a concrete example.

Bob: Purpose is used in man apropos search; the ability to put
distinct keywords in there would be very useful.

|      541444 caption in mediaobjectco 

Norm: It looks like mediaobjectco has gotten out of sync with mediaobject.

ACTION: Norm to propose a new content model for mediaobjectco to bring
them back in sync.

|      558443 include storage info in metadata 

Bob demonstrated that this is possible. This issue should be closed.

ACTION: Bob to amend the RFE and then close it.

|      562343 &lt;packagename&gt; element 

Waiting for Norm to complete action.

|      565637 Associate non-inline image with link 

Waiting for resolution of generalized linking.

|      565716 URL and URN markup 

ACTION: Mike to summarize the issue and propose a new URI element with
appropriate attribute names and values.

|      573419 Add bidirectional text overrides 

ACTION: Norm to ask Tony/Paul for a summary of what is missing from
DocBook to support proper mixed bidi text.

|      582822 VARARG and FUNCDEF together 

Proposed: Adopt the proposal[8]

Accepted.

|      623524 (Re)Consider &quot;choicelist&quot; markup 

ACTION: Norm to put on the agenda for next month.

|      638456 RFE add a &lt;translator&gt; tag

We discussed this last month and suggested a solution[2]. There's been
some positive feedback and no negative feedback.

Proposed: Adopt this proposal.

Accepted.

|      655526 funcprototype enhancement

Proposed: Adopt this proposal.

Accepted.

|      660044 Controlling line numbering in verbatims

Proposed: Adopt this proposal.

NW: Use startinglinenumber=nnn, continuation=continues|restarts
If both are specified, startinglinenumber wins.

Accepted.

ADJOURNED by Dick's departure (no longer have quorum). Continuing informally.

|      679316 Allow orgname tag within paragraphs

ACTION: Bob to review the list of bibliography elements and see which
ones make sense in paragraph. Orgname is requested here, we already
allow author and corpauthor. What about others?

|      686733 allow bibliography under &lt;refentry&gt;

ACTION: Norm to ask Denis Evans for his opinions as he was our man
page expert.

|      685511 shading/color support for tables

For Scott's purposes, the PIs are probably a workable solution.

BS: People could use roles for this and then customize the stylesheets.

SC: We use processing instructions as well.

BS: It's not really part of the semantic model of the element. There's
no indication in the actual element that there's a semantic reason for
it to be shaded. I can easily see role used as an alternative for
this.

NW: For the DocBook stylesheets, you'd have to use two PIs so it might
make sense to have a common PI for both HTML and FO.

SC: Maybe it makes sense to define some common processing
instructions.

NW: Maybe this would be a chance for us to say, &quot;here use this one&quot;.

ACTION: Norm to put releasein 4.3 or 5.0 or whatever's next on the agenda.
