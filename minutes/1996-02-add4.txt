Martin,

Thanks very much for your extensive information on notations.
Rather than add substantially to the DocBook notation declaration
list, I think it makes sense to update the ones we have incrementally,
and simply make your list available at the Davenport archive for
people to peruse till the TR is available.  Would that be okay
to do?  (Terry, what do you think?)

        Eve
