5g. Committee charter

Norm circulated a draft [2], and it was commented on by
Karl Best of OASIS [3].   Some of the comments may
not apply to a committee that mostly does maintenance
of an existing standard.  Norm will ask Karl for
clarification.  We also need to set specific goals, and Norm
suggested that DocBook 4.4 be done this year, and
DocBook 5.0 be done next year.

Based on Karl's comments, Norm
will create a second draft for the next meeting.

ACTION: Norm to write second draft charter.

6. Status of DTD version 4.4 beta

Norm released DocBook 4.4b2 on 26 August. [4]
He suggested everyone test drive it so that we
can designate it a CR1 release at the next meeting.

7. Bug in Simplified DocBook 1.1 CR1 (Mark)

Norm identified two bugs: one in subscript and superscript,
and one in system ids pointing to Norm's hard drive.
Suggestions for fixes were accepted.

ACTION: Norm to release CR2.


8. "Committee Draft" vs. "OASIS Standard".

Bob related the story of one vendor who was holding off
on implementing DocBook 4.3 because it was labeled as
a "Committee Draft", which implies that it is not finished.
Norm reported that OASIS removed the designation "Committee Specification"
and so only "OASIS Standard" is available.  The latter requires
more work to receive because the full OASIS membership must vote.
Norm thinks the Committee Specification designation may come
back.

ACTION: Norm to write to OASIS requesting restoration of Committee
Specification
or equivalent.  He should cite Bob's vendor example.


9. Annotation proposal (Mike).  [5] [6]

Norm implemented an annotation scheme based on Mike's proposal. [7]
Discussion of two content models for annotation: simple and
complex. simple is basically text and would be used in
output attribute values and tool tips).  Complex could include
paras, lists, tables, etc. and would be presented in a separate
area.  Both are needed for different circumstances
Larry suggested two elements with different content models:
annotation and shortannotation or simpleannotation.
Steve suggested a single annotation element
with child elements determining simple or complex.
No final decision yet.  Decided to post Norm's page and
start a discussion on the list.

ACTION: Norm to post his annotations page to the mailing list.

10. Accessibility.

Discussed Larry's list [8] of potential improvements
for accessibility.  Many can be done with an annotation
mechanism, so they will be considered together.  Current
use of attributes has limitations: some browsers only
show first 100 characters of the title attribute text.
One additional area is making tables more accessible.
Norm will forward info from Larry about tables.

ACTION: Norm to forward Larry's mail about table accessibility.

ACTION: Norm to contact Mark Pilgrim, author of
Dive Into Accessibility [9], about accessibility issues.


11. Discuss guidelines for accepting or rejecting requests.

Gary reported on his review of ISO9000, which recommended
that we fully document our process and results.  He suggested
creating a flow diagram would help.  We currently use the
SourceForge RFE mechanism to track and document the requests.
We could be more careful in adding comments as issues are
resolved.  We will consider this item again at the
next meeting.


12. html:form should be available in more places
   than in %divcomponent.mix;  [10] [11]

Bob sent a proposal to the list [12]
suggesting additional places where the html:form element
could be added.  Norm proposed we adopt the proposal.
The proposal was accepted.

13a.  Review DocBook 4.4 content.
