True. Also see the examples in Annex D of 8879. In fact, look at productions
79-93. [80] defines three types of owner identifiers: ISO owner identifier,
registered owner identifiers, and unregistered owner identifiers. [81] 
defines an ISO owner identifier to be minimum data, [82] defines a registered
owner identifier to start with "+//", and [83] defines an unregistered
owner identifier to start with "-//".

True in practice. If you want to be technical, ANSI is the registration
authority, but they do not have procedures in place for actually registering
owners. The GCA has volunteered to actual do the work for ANSI and
expects ANSI approval of their suggested procedures, but when I last 
checked with Marion Elledge at the GCA a week or two ago, it hadn't
happened yet.

True.

Can't hurt to ask.

Again, true.
