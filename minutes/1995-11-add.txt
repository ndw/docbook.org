The "ArborText" math is (with just a couple exceptions) the earlier AAP
math tag definitions.

The 12083 math is the result of the revision of the AAP math.  Eric
van Herwijnen, editor of 12083, is holding a 12083 discussion session
in Boston the week of SGML 95.  One of the topics will be possible
review of 12083 math.  (That's not to say it will be revised--in fact,
I'm against any major revision--but the discussion will raise the issue.)

Anders Berglund is (and has been) editor of ISO TR 9573 which has defined
a math tagging that was referenced by CALS, though there remains little
support for it.  CALS now refers to it as one of several choices (and 
also mentions 12083 as a choice).  Someone--maybe WordPerfect--has announced
some support for 9573 recently.

Euromath is something else.  Paul Ellison of Univ of Exeter
(P.A.Ellison@exeter.ac.uk), Nico Poppelier of Elsevier
(N.POPPELIER@ELSEVIER.nl), Bjorn von Sydow Chalmers University, Sweden
(sydow@cs.chalmers.se), Richard Timoney of Trinity College, Dublin
(richardt@maths.tcd.ie), and Tibor Tscheke of STEP (step@step.de) are
some folks who should be able to give you better pointers and info
about Euromath.

I chaired the AAP review several years ago that included input from
various sources and many mathematicians, and if there was any clear
result, it was that this is a religious issue almost as bad as table
tagging but even harder to support arbitrary tagging.  Most mathematicians
and typesetters agreed that one could not define all math tagging in
terms of semantics, and that after a possibly semantic core, one had
to have mostly geometric tagging.  The 12083 math came out of this effort.

SGML Open might be a reasonable organization to do a survey of this
issue, but it depends on member support.  (Things only get done when
we have someone volunteer as subcommittee chair that gets things done.)

In terms of support, there is some for ISO TR 9573, some for the original
AAP tagging, and some--not a lot, but generally growing--support for 12083.
Of those talking about added support (or users wanting added support), I
generally hear about 12083.

Then there is the large crowd that just wants to interchange the math
in their SGML documents using TeX.
