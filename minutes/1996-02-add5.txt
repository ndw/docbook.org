At the tail end of the meeting, we decided on a few V4.0
backwards-incompatible changes that I didn't mention in my 
original DocBook notes.  Here they are; please comment as
for the original message:

o (As Terry mentioned and Con replied) Remove Comment/link.char.class
  from appearing directly in RefEntry and RefName Div; possibly
  allow Comment but not link.char.class?  Allow Comment as an
  inclusion on RefEntry?

o Remove AuthorBlurb and Abstract from the descobj.class, while
  ensuring they are in the new DocMeta element.

o Reduce the content of docinfo.char.class for use in text: Remove
  all but ProductName, ProductNumber, and ModeSpec.  Ensure that the
  other contexts that use docinfo.char.class have the full complement.

  Note that the only other use for the class is in SetInfo.  Should
  SetInfo just be turned into DocMeta at V4.0, similarly to the other
  meta situations?

o Consider simplifying the MsgSet content model, or at least offering
  a "simple model for simple cases" alternative to the current model;
  Jon will propose the change in mail.


Thanks,

	Eve
