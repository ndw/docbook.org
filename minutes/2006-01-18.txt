 COMPLETED.
    

6.  Default attribute values in DocBook 5.
    Other DocBook 5 issues.

The TC reviewed the default attribute values present in
DocBook 4.5 to see of they should be carried over to
version 5.  The group felt that most of them were 
obvious and could be converted to IMPLIED rather than
a default value.  But the following attributes were deemed
sufficiently useful to be included in the RNG grammar
and expressed in the DTD version of the schema:

<!ATTLIST simplelist
                type             (inline|vert|horiz)       "vert"

<!ATTLIST methodparam
                choice     (opt|req|plain)                "req"
                rep        (norepeat|repeat)           "norepeat"

<!ATTLIST arg
                choice         (opt|req|plain)                'opt'
                rep            (norepeat|repeat)        'norepeat'

<!ATTLIST group
                choice         (opt|req|plain)         'opt'
                rep            (norepeat|repeat)        'norepeat'

ACTION: Norm to add the DTD default attribute syntax
to the V5 RNG grammar.

ACTION: Norm to express the default value in the DTD version.

Larry asked about a note in the XSD version that says it
permits more than the RNG grammar.  Norm said that note
is incorrect.

ACTION: Norm to remove the note from the XSD version.

ACTION: Larry to test token string in both XSD and RNG validation.

7. Review of Requests for Enhancement

      group_id=21935&atid=384107&aid=XXXX

      1306027  Support for annotations in synopsis elements  
               CONTINUED.

      1358844  allow multiple imageobject in imageobjectco  

Approved.  The group determined that if different file formats
of an image were the same size and the areas could be
specified with the same areaspec, then it should be permitted
to have more than one imageobject inside an imageobjectco
to reuse the areaspec.  Only one imageobject would be
used per output form.  If an areaspec cannot be reused
for more than one format, then the author must use 
more than one imageobjectco elements with separate
areaspec elements.

ACTION: Norm to add to V5.

ACTION: Norm to document it in The Definitive Guide.

8.  Scott mentioned an email describing a problem
in Simplified DocBook 1.1

ACTION: Scott to file an RFE about the problem.
