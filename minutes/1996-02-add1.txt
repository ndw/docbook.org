Chart is something from CALS 38784 that I've never seen used in practice
and which is really just a table with some possibly different formatting
(e.g., Charts numbered independently of Tables, which is really a style
sheet issue).  Forgetting charts is probably a good idea.

Please double check this.  My reading of 8879 indicates that the above
is not a valid Formal Public Idendifier.  According to productions 79-81,
if an FPI is to have an ISO owner identifier, it does *not* have the
initial "+//".  In fact, my understanding is that "+//" is for registered
owner identifiers only, and at the present time, there is no official
registration body, so there can be no registered owners and therefore
no "+//" FPIs except those that use ISBNs (which are registered).  

Furthermore, 8879 is officially "ISO 8879:1986" not "ISO/IEC 8879:1986"
(see, for example, all the FPIs for the character sets in annex D of 8879).

I think having an official FPI for SGML notation is a great idea, but
since the owner of 8879 is SC18/WG8, I think you should ask them to
determine and bless an official FPI.  (The convenor of WG8 is James
Mason [MASONJD@oax.a1.ornl.gov] and the editor of the WG8 SGML
Rapporteur Group is Charles Goldfarb [charles@sgmlsource.com].)  My
apologies if I'm off base on this, but the FPI above doesn't seem right
to me, and I do think it's important we don't proliferate
invalid/inappropriate FPIs.

If/when you decide to revisit this, one other piece of background might
be the conloc concept of HyTime.  This is basically just a semantic that
says that, for an element with a CONREF attribute, the conref'ed entity
shall be treated for processing purposes as if it were the content of the 
element with the CONREF attribute.  I've only recently reviewed this again;
Eliot can elaborate.

I sent private email to Eve/Terry on this making some comments and requesting
some clarification.  Eve/Terry, we can continue this offline or you can
choose to bring it to the list.
