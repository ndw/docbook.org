3. Next meeting: 19 May 2004.
   No conflicts.

4. Review of the agenda.
   No additions.

5. Review of open action items

    a. Mike to provide a better proposal for choicelist markup.
       CONTINUE.

    b. Mike to reconsider the annotation problem and post his thoughts.
       CONTINUE.

    c. Dick to examine the use of alt, possibly as part 
       of the annotation discussion.
       CONTINUE: Dick and Larry to collaborate on this item.

    d. Norm to summarize the OASIS requirements document for
       the document management system and the ensuing discussion.
       CONTINUE.

    e. Norm to complete the reference pages for the
       new 4.3 elements on the docbook.org site.
       CONTINUE.

    f. Norm to publish these unofficial versions
        - RelaxNG XML version
        - RelaxNG compact syntax version
        - W3C XML Schema
        - flattened version of the XML DTD
 COMPLETED all but the flattened version.

    g. Norm to post a reference to the paper written
       with Sebastian Rahtz regarding TEI.
       CONTINUE.

    h. Norm to produce a draft spec of 5.0.
       CONTINUE.

6. OASIS document management system. 

   No news.

7. DocBook V4.3 bug report: no catalog entry
   for HTML table module.

   This may trigger a version 4.3.1 DTD.
   Wait for one month to see if more bug reports released.
   
8. Where is new biblioref element permitted?
   %xref.char.class is smaller than %link.char.class

   Not sure why the allowed locations of xref and link are different.

   ACTION: Norm to investigate and propose where biblioref should
   be permitted.

9. Using textdata to generalize programlisting.

   The TC does not want to add another element for this purpose.
   They felt that programlisting and literallayout, possibly with
   role attribute, sufficiently satisfy the need.  The TC will
   reconsider the element names for 5.0 to make them more general.

10. Request for canonical URIs for Docbook DTDs. [2]

   Norm says using OASIS as the canonical URIs is the right answer,
   but the current document management system and its non-stable
   URIs make that difficult. Perhaps use docbook.org instead?

   ACTION: Norm to ask Karl about creating stable OASIS URIs.

11. Review of Requests for Enhancement

      group_id=21935&atid=384107&aid=XXXX

543064 JavaObject tag
and 675024 form, script, applet support

  These two items were considered together. The TC felt adding 
  DocBook elements to support HTML-only constructs is not a good
  design. They suggested using processing instructions or
  local extensions.  REJECTED.

698026 cannot embed <superscript> within <guibutton>

  Accepted in spirit, but not sure if super/subscript should
  be added to the smallcptr.class.mix parameter entity.
  ACTION: Norm to suggest how to implement this.

702185 add procedure as child of para

  Since para is a child of step, this request would end up
  permitting nested procedures, which should be handled
  with substeps, Also, the TC questions the original decision
  to permit lists in para at all, so did not feel compelled
  to add another even more complicated list structure.
  REJECTED.
  
711815 Tagging for subtler breaks or "pauses" within a chapter

  The TC did not see a sufficient need for this, and
  suggested using a bridgehead or processing instruction instead.
  REJECTED.

742373 Splitting Segmented List

  The TC felt this was a very specialized request, and would
  require significant changes to support it.  The TC suggested
  using text entities, XIncludes, or even a variablelist to
  handle this need.  REJECTED.

752632 Color control of CALS table element

  This is a duplicate of RFE 685511, which was rejected in October 2003.
  The TC suggested using a processing instruction or the HTML
  table model, available in version 4.3 of the DTD. REJECTED.

828720 'spacing' attr. for 'variablelist'

  ACCEPTED.  Not sure when it will be released.
  
933955 Add subscript and superscript to Simplified.

  ACCEPTED.

541444 caption in mediaobjectco (Dick)
  
  ACTION: Dick to determine if this item is closed.

562343 <packagename> element (Mark)

  ACCEPTED, created <package> at the Feb 2004 meeting.

613293 Generalize programlisting (Steve)

  See agenda item #9 above.  REJECTED
