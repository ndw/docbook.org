<title>Simplified DocBook</title>

<para>This is a community project; it <emphasis>is not</emphasis> an
official product of the DocBook Technical Committee.</para>

<para>Over the years, the notion of a "simple" DocBook subset has come up
many times.  It has been observed that the number of elements in
DocBook can be a little overwhelming to the new user.
</para>

<para>Simplified DocBook is a small subset of DocBook.
The <link xlink:href="sdocbook/">online summary</link> shows just how
small this subset is.
</para>

<para>This DTD is an attempt to make a small subset of DocBook.
The goals of this subset are:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Documents written in the subset must be 100% legal DocBook
documents.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>This subset for single documents (articles, white papers, etc.),
so there's no need for books or sets, just 'articles'.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The markup should be the smallest practical subset, if you need
richly structured markup, use full DocBook. In
particular, the subset often selects a single element from a family of
related elements; for example, <tag>programlisting</tag> is
provided, but <tag>screen</tag> is not.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The DTD must work in online browsers (it's XML not SGML). It
must be small enough to download more-or-less painlessly.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
