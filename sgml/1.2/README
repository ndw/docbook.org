README

This directory contains several versions of the DocBook DTD,
their documentation, an SGML declaration, and some sample files.  
As of 2 March 1993 two versions of this DTD are available, 1.0 
(for historical reference) and 1.2 (the current version).  
The documentation for DTD version 1.0 is out of date, 
but may still be useful, especially for RefEntries (man pages).  

As of 2 March 1993 the documentation for the DTD version 1.2 consists of 
an alphabetical list of elements, with definitions.  This list
is available in both PostScript and SGML formats.
Additional documentation will be forthcoming.  

DocBook 1.2 is an expanded and revised version of 1.0, including 
many in-line elements, some specific, some general and inclusive.  
Valid documents may of course be constructed with a subset of
these in-line elements---don't feel you must use them all.

The DTD does not establish detailed rules for the usage of 
elements.  This is a matter for editors and writers to deal with.

Please note that the DTD has an associated SGML declaration,
also to be found in this directory.

To get all of the files relevant to version 1.2, obtain the file
named docbook1.2.shar.
