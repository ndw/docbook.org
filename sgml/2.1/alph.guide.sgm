<CHAPTER><TITLE>The Elements Alphabetized</TITLE>
<PARA>Emphasized entries indicate
block-oriented elements.
&ldquo;Dropped&rdquo; elements appeared in version 1.2.2 but do not
appear in the current version; many have been shifted
to attribute values in cptrphrase.gp.
</PARA>
<SECT1><TITLE>Common Attributes</TITLE>
<PARA>Common attributes now include ID, Lang (language), Remap
(to store the former GI of an element in a document filtered
to Docbook), Role (to type Docbook elements when
need be), and XRefLabel (text to be displayed as the 
label of cross references to a block-oriented element).
</PARA>
<PARA>ID is an identifier, which must be a
string that is unique at least within the document and
which must begin with a letter.  Lang should be a
language code drawn from ISO 639 (perhaps extended with
a country code drawn from ISO 3166, as en&lowbar;US).  Use 
it when you need to signal your application to change
hyphenation and other display characteristics.
Remap is a device for
preserving a previous tag name when fitting a document
to the DocBook DTD.  
Think of <SGMLTAG>CHAPTER Remap=&ldquo;Fascicle&rdquo;</SGMLTAG>
as saying, &ldquo;I'm a Chapter now, but in a previous life
I was a Fascicle.&rdquo;  Role allows you to clone DocBook
elements without creating new ones:  if you have lists
of vegetables and lists of fruit (perhaps displayed
differently), give them 
<SGMLTAG>Role=vegetables</SGMLTAG> and <SGMLTAG>Role=fruit</SGMLTAG> attributes.
</PARA></SECT1>
<SECT1><TITLE>Other Attributes</TITLE>
<PARA>Certain other attributes occur regularly.  PageNum is
the number of the page on which a given element begins
or occurs in a printed book.  Label holds some text 
associated with its element that is to be output when
the document is rendered.  XRefLabel holds some text
that is to be used when a cross reference (XRef)
is made to its element.  Type is used with links,
as it is clear that different types of links may be
required; it duplicates the function of Role.
</PARA>
<PARA>The Class attribute has been introduced in an attempt to
control the number of computer-specific in-line elements.
The elements that bear the Class attribute, such as 
Interface, have general
meanings that can be made more specific 
by providing a value for Class from the delimited list
for that element.  For example, for the Interface element
one may specify Menu, or Button; for the MediaLabel
element one may specify CDRom or Tape.  Each element
has its own list of permissible values for Class, and
no default is set, so you can ignore this attribute
if you wish.  
</PARA>
<PARA>Some attributes are defined with the keyword &percnt;yesorno;,
which resolves to NUMBER.  To supply the required number,
which must be either 1 or 0, you can use the 
parameter entities &percnt;yes; (1); or &percnt;no; (0).
</PARA>
<PARA>An attributes that has the keyword IMPLIED bears no
processing expections if it is absent or its 
value is null.  Application designers might wish to
supply plausible defaults, but none is specified here.
However, it would be plausible to imply that the 
language of a DocBook instance is U.S. English 
unless specified otherwise.  (This matter may be clarified
when character set specification is added to the DTD;
for now, the character set must be inferred from the
Lang attribute value, if present.)
</PARA></SECT1>
<SECT1><TITLE>cptrphrase.gp</TITLE>
<PARA>This parameter entity has been introduced to provide
some structure for in-line elements related to computers.
Its contents are:  plain text,
Anchor, BeginPage, all the index
terms, Comment, Subscript, Superscript,
all the kinds of links, Action, Application, ClassName,
Command, 
ComputerOutput,
Database, ErrorName, ErrorType, 
EventStructure, EventType,
Filename, Function, Hardware, Interface,
InterfaceDefinition, KeyCap, KeyCode, KeySym, LineAnnotation,
Literal, Mask, MediaLabel, MsgText, Option,
Optional, Parameter, Property, ProtocolRequest,
Replaceable, ReturnValue, StructField, StructName, Symbol,
SystemDialog, SystemItem, Token, Type, and UserInput.
</PARA>
<PARA>Many of these elements now have attributes 
with delimited value lists; some former in-line elements now appear as 
values for those attributes.
</PARA></SECT1>
<SECT1><TITLE>&ldquo;In-line&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;In flow&rdquo;</TITLE>
<PARA>In this document, &ldquo;in-line&rdquo; means &rdquo;occuring within a line 
of text, like a character or character string, not causing
a line break.&rdquo;  This term is sometimes used to 
refer to objects such as an illustration around which 
something like a paragraph is wrapped; here that circumstance
will be called &ldquo;in flow.&rdquo;  There is no provision yet
for indicating that an object is in flow, but one could
make creative use of the Role attribute to do so.
</PARA>
<PARA>A related point:  formal objects have titles; informal 
objects do not.  That an object is informal does not mean
that it is in-line:  these are two different 
characteristics.
</PARA></SECT1>
<SECT1><TITLE>CALS Tables</TITLE>
<PARA>In this revision, the former Table models have been 
replaced by one derived from MIL-M-28001B, dated
26 July 1993 (supersedes MIL-M-28001A of 20 July 
1990.)
The documentation of Table and its subelements,
below, has been taken from that document,
with some editing and attempts at clarification.

main contents, and back matter.  The main contents are
required, and must be one or more Parts;
one or more Chapters followed by any 
number of References;
one or more Articles; or one or more References.  
All back matter is optional, but must appear in order:
any number of Appendices, 
a Glossary, a Bibliography, and any number of Indexes
and SetIndexes,
followed by any number of LoTs followed by an optional
ToC. Book has common, FPI, and Label
attributes.  The FPI attribute is intended to hold an
SGML Formal Public Identifier for the Book;
the Label attribute can be used to supply the 
number of a Book, or you can use the content of the VolumeNum element in BookInfo.  
in constructing Formal Public Identifiers you use
your ISBN publisher's prefix.  In the ISBN 
1&ndash;565692&ndash;043&ndash;0, for example, the publisher's 
prefix is 565692.

optional SynopFragments.  CmdSynopsis has common,
Label, and Sepchar attributes.  Label has no 
default; Sepchar has the default &ldquo; &rdquo;.
The following is courtesy Eve Maler (see also
the entries for the subelements elsewhere in
this list:
</PARA>
<PARA>An argument at the command level (Arg)
is a parameter passed to a
command to specify or modify the command's behavior; it 
often consists of a variable value 
(Replaceable) 
such as a filename field, or an option
(Option) and its own nested 
argument (Arg).  If the contents of an
argument are not marked up further, they are assumed to be 
something the user must type as shown (probably an option, 
but this is implicit).  The Choice attribute on the two 
argument elements indicates whether the argument must be 
present (&ldquo;Req&rdquo;, the default), whether it
is optional (&ldquo;Opt&rdquo;), or whether no indication of presence 
is given (&ldquo;Plain&rdquo;, the default).  
</PARA>
<PARA>A group (Group) as a peer 
or child of an argument is a 
collection of arguments, options, or other constructs that must appear in some
relation to each other.  For example, three options that are 
exclusive of each other and are optional would be in a group 
with a choice of &ldquo;Opt&rdquo; (the default).  
The &ldquo;Optmult&rdquo; choice allows zero or more of the
children of the group to be supplied, and the &ldquo;Reqmult&rdquo; 
choice requires one or more of the children of the group to 
be supplied.
</PARA>
<PARA>An option (Option) is a literal string or name of a 
parameter-keyword controlling the behavior of the command; a 
variable value (Replaceable) is a
mnemonic name for a value that the user must supply, such as 
an input file name.  The Option and Replaceable 
elements are available in text as
well as in synopses.  Stacks of options (for example, 
&ldquo;-aefstuv&rdquo;) should 
be put into a single Option element for simplicity.
</PARA>
<PARA>Depressingly complex constructs may 
appear anywhere within a 
synopsis.  A SynopFragment reference (SynopFragmentRef) is a
special kind of variable value assigned in place of this 
construct, which is 
then broken out into its own synopsis subset (SynopFragment) for
clarity.  A SynopFragment must have an ID, and any 
SynopFragmentRefs supplied 
must point to some SynopFragment.  
</PARA>
<PARA>Plain text within a CmdSynopsis 
is allowed only inside Cmd, Arg,
Option, Replaceable, and SynopFragmentRef.  The
top-level separator character attribute 
value (&ldquo; &rdquo; by default) should 
be used to separate arguments and groups 
from their repeat indicators (&ldquo;. . .&rdquo;) and 
to separate Commands and their arguments and groups at the top level.
</PARA>
<PARA>The CmdSynopsis structure does 
not meet the needs of DCL 
and other VMS-related command languages that have command 
parameters such 
as /[NO]WRITE, positional versus nonpositional parameters, and so on.
Probably additional low-level elements would have to be 
added to the mix and the top-level structure enhanced 
slightly to account for
these.  However, CmdSynopsis
appears to meet most UNIX-related needs.
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Processing expectations:</EMPHASIS>
The &ldquo;Opt&rdquo; settings on arguments and groups (and probably 
&ldquo;Optmult&rdquo; as
well for now) should produce square brackets.  
The &ldquo;Req&rdquo;
settings (and probably &ldquo;Reqmult&rdquo; as well for now) 
should produce curly braces.  The children of Group (if 
there is more than one child) should be either separated by vertical bars or formatted as a stacked list.
Spacing at the Command and Group levels
is controlled by formatter defaults and/or the 
sepchar setting.

Each ColSpec is for a single column, so it properly has a  
column number, Colnum, implicitly in order starting  
from 1, and an optional Colname by which it is known when 
used in any SpanSpec or in Entry. 
A ColSpec set on THead or TFoot should be complete for 
all columns.  It overrides those on the containing TGroup 
and applies to just the THead or 
TFoot.  If there is no ColSpec used within THead or 
TFoot, then the ColSpec of the containing TGroup (or the  
prior TGroup) is used.  ColSpecs from the containing 
TGroup apply to TBody. 
</PARA>
<PARA>For <EMPHASIS>TGroupStyle</EMPHASIS>, see <EMPHASIS>TGroup.</EMPHASIS>
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Align</EMPHASIS> controls the horizontal position 
of text within the column.  
The value of Align may be Left (quad flush left), 
Center (centered), Right (quad flush right), 
Justify (both quad left and right), or Char (align to
the left of Char, positioned by Charoff).  There is
no default. 
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Char</EMPHASIS> contributes to Align.  If the
value of Align is &ldquo;char&rdquo;, the value of Char
should be a character on the first occurrance
of which the entry is to be aligned.  If that 
character does not occur in the entry, the entry 
is aligned to the left of the position determined
by Charoff.  (Think of using the decimal point to
align decimal numbers:  Char=&ldquo;. &rdquo;and
Charoff says how far over in the column the decimals
should be; if no decimal occurs, the number is an
integer and is aligned to the left of the decimals.)
No value implies there
is no character to align on.
The default is implied, from the enclosing TGroup.
(That is, you normally declare that an entire TGroup
shall be decimal-aligned, but if you need to align
a specific column differently, you can do it by
specifying another Char at the ColSpec level.) 
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Charoff</EMPHASIS> contributes with Char to Align.
Charoff is the proportion
of the current column width, expressed in percentage,
to be allowed before the left edge of the first occurrence
of the character given as the value of Char.
The default is inherited from the enclosing TGroup. 
That is, if columns in a TGroup are to be decimal-aligned,
and the decimal point is to fall three-quarters of the
way across each cell (most of your numbers are of the 
form 123.4), you could set Charoff to 75 in
TGroup; that value would be inherited by ColSpec, where
you could modify it for a specific column (for
example, by setting it to
50 for a column of numbers of the form 12.34).
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Colname</EMPHASIS> gives the name of the column, which
is used 
to specify the position in a row, or the start or end of a 
horizontal span of columns (SpanSpec).  There is no default.
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Colnum</EMPHASIS> gives the number of the column, 
counting from 1 at left of the table.
There is no default. 
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Colsep</EMPHASIS> 
determines column separators.  If its value
is Yes, display the internal column rulings to 
the right of each item; if No, do not 
display it.  It is ignored for the last column, where the 
Frame setting applies.  There is no default.  The
value is inherited from TGroupStyle if used.  
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Colwidth</EMPHASIS> is either a proportional 
measure of the form <EMPHASIS>number*</EMPHASIS>, such as &ldquo;5*&rdquo; for  
5 times the proportion, or &ldquo;*&rdquo; (=&ldquo;1*&rdquo;); or a  
fixed measure, such as 2pt for 2 
points, 3pc for 3 picas; or a mixed measure, such as 2*+3pt.  
Coefficients are positive numbers with up to 
two decimal places.  There is no default.
If no value is given, the value should
be obtained from the FOSI, or, if there is no FOSI value, 
the value 1 should be used.  (Perhaps this means that 
you can vary the width of columns by stating their relative
proportions, or you can give fixed widths.  If you use
a decimal number less than zero, express it in the form
0.2, not .2.)
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Rowsep</EMPHASIS> 
determines row separators.  If its content is 
Yes, display the internal vertical row ruling 
below each item; if No, do not display it.  It is 
ignored for the last row of the table, where 
the value of Frame applies to the entire Table.  
There is no default.
The value is inherited from TGroupStyle, if used.

<LISTITEM>
<PARA>A euphemism for a cell in a table&mdash;you'd
rather be in an Entry than in a Cell, wouldn't you?  
An Entry occurs in
a Row, and must have either some assortment 
of paragraphs, admonitions, lists,
and Graphics, or in-line elements.  
Entry has common
and Align, Char, Charoff, Colname, Colsep,
Morerows, Nameend, Namest, 
Rotate, Rowsep, Spanname, and VAlign attributes.  
Attribute values may be inherited
from enclosing elements that share the same
attribute.
&ldquo;An Entry not specified by a SpanSpec gets its
defaults from its starting column.&rdquo;
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Align</EMPHASIS> controls the horizontal position 
of text within the column.  
The value of Align may be Left (quad flush left), 
Center (centered), Right (quad flush right), 
Justify (both quad left and right), or Char (align on  
leftmost of Char, positioned by Charoff).  There is
no default; the value may be inherited from 
ColSpec or SpanSpec. 
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Char</EMPHASIS> contributes to Align.  If the
value of Align is &ldquo;char&rdquo;, the value of Char
should be a character on the first occurrance
of which the entry is to be aligned.  If that 
character does not occur in the entry, the entry 
is aligned to the left (the original doc incorrectly
specifies &ldquo;right&rdquo;)
of the position determined
by Charoff.  
The default is inherited; no value implies there
is no character to align on.
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Charoff</EMPHASIS> contributes with Char to Align.
Charoff is the proportion
of the current column width, expressed in percentage,
to be allowed before the left edge of the first occurrence
of the character given as the value of Char, if any.
The default is inherited from ColSpec or SpanSpec. 
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Colname</EMPHASIS> gives the name of the column, 
which is used 
to specify the position in a row, or the start or end of a 
horizontal span of columns (SpanSpec).  There is no default;
omit if SpanName is present.  The implied value is either
the first column of the Row, or, if already in a Row,
the next column after the end of the prior Entry or 
EntryTbl.
</PARA> 
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Colsep</EMPHASIS> determines column separators.  
If its value
is Yes, display the internal column rulings to 
the right of each Entry; if No, do not 
display it.  It is ignored for the last column, where the 
Frame setting applies.  (In CALS, 
Yes is expressed as 1 and No as 0.) 
There is no default; if no value is given the
value is inherited from ColSpec or SpanSpec.  
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Morerows</EMPHASIS> is the number of 
additional rows in a 
vertical straddle.  The default is 0.
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Nameend</EMPHASIS> is the name of the rightmost

</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Rotate</EMPHASIS> 
governs rotations, which are not additive to 
those specified in the FOSI.  
Values may be Yes or No (1 or 0).
No specifies no rotation; Yes specifies 
90 degrees rotation counterclockwise 
to table orientation.  No other values are 
supported!
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Rowsep</EMPHASIS> 
determines row separators.  If its content is 
Yes, display the internal vertical row ruling 
below each item; if No, do not display it.  It is 
ignored for the last row of the table, where 
the frame value applies.  There is no default.
The value is inherited from Row, if used there.  
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Spanname</EMPHASIS> is the name of a horizontal span. 
No default.
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>VAlign</EMPHASIS> governs the vertical 
positioning of text within an Entry.  
Allowed values are Top, Middle, and Bottom
(no default).
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>
<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><EMPHASIS>EntryTbl</EMPHASIS></TERM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>A form of subtable. It
may occur in Row, along with Entry.  
Several EntryTbls of differing formats 
may occur in the same Row of a
TBody, but EntryTbl may not contain itself.  Aside
from that restriction, EntryTbl contains one or
more sets of these elements, in order:
any number of ColSpecs, any number of SpanSpecs,
an optional THead, and a required TBody.
There is no implication
of alignment of subrows in different EntryTbls.
Default attribute values come instead from those
of like-named attributes on enclosing
elements:  Table, TGroup,
ColSpec, SpanSpec, THead, TFoot, TBody, or
Row.  EntryTbl has common, Align,
Char, Charoff, ColName, Cols, Colsep, Nameend, Namest,
Rowsep, Spanname, and TGroupStyle attributes.
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Align</EMPHASIS> controls the horizontal position 
of text within the column.  
The value of Align may be Left (quad flush left), 
Center (centered), Right (quad flush right), 
Justify (both quad left and right), or Char (align to
the  
left of Char, positioned by Charoff).  There is
no default; the value may be inherited from ColSpec
or SpanSpec. 
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Char</EMPHASIS> contributes to Align.  If the
value of Align is &ldquo;char&rdquo;, the value of Char
should be a character on the first occurrance
of which the entry is to be aligned.  If that 
character does not occur in the entry, the entry 
is aligned to the left (the original doc incorrectly
specifies &ldquo;right&rdquo;) of the position determined
by Charoff.  There is no default.
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Charoff</EMPHASIS> contributes with Char to Align.
Charoff is the proportion
of the current column width, expressed in percentage,
to be allowed before the left edge of the first occurrence
of the character given as the value of Char, if any.
The default is inherited from the enclosing TGroup. 
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Colname</EMPHASIS> gives the name of the

<PARA>(contributed Eve Maler, along

A C synopsis that shows a prototype or

also indicates the data type of its return value, and 
the positions, purposes, and data types of its
parameters.  A FuncSynopsis begins with an
optional FuncSynopsisInfo, which contains additional
information about the synopsis that follows; line breaks
and leading white space are significant within a 
FuncSynopsisInfo.  This is followed by 
one or more blocks defining a function (you might
use more than one for connecting related sets of functions).  
Each of these blocks consists of a required FuncDef, 
followed by a Void, a VarArgs, or one or more ParamDefs.  
Void, Varargs, and and ParamDef
are mutually exclusive.  <EMPHASIS>Usage Note:</EMPHASIS>
You should supply no specific information on the arguments before the ellipsis that VarArgs should output when

to represent the ellipsis in the source it may 
ben enclosed within a final ParamDef.
FuncSynopsis has common and Label attributes.
</PARA>
<PARA>The processing application is expected to 
provide all parentheses, semicolons, and the like.  The 
exceptions are any spaces surrounding function and parameter 
names, any parentheses or commas or spacing 
inside lists of data types of parameters that are pointers 
to functions, and the parentheses around those parameter

SimPara has common attributes.
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>
<VARLISTENTRY><TERM><EMPHASIS>SimpleList</EMPHASIS></TERM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>Intended for long lists of single words
or short phrases.  It consists of one or more Members, and
has common, Columns, and Type attributes.  The value of 
the Type attribute may be Inline, Horiz, or Vert (the 
default), indicating that the list should be formatted
as part of a regular paragraph, as an array reading L to R
then top to bottom, or 
as an array reading top to bottom then L to R.
The Columns attribute value must be a number, the number
of columns the array should contain.  Further details
on rendering may be found in the comment in the DTD,
but these details may required some revision in the 
future. 
</PARA></LISTITEM></VARLISTENTRY>
<VARLISTENTRY><TERM>SpanSpec</TERM>
<LISTITEM>
<PARA>Formatting information for a 
spanned column in a TGroup (part of Table).  
SpanSpec is an empty element, bearing common, Align, 
Char, Charoff, Colsep, Nameend (required),
Namest (required), Rowsep, and Spanname,
(required) attributes.
SpanSpec identifies a horizontal span of  
columns and associated attributes that can 
subsequently be referenced by its SpanName to 
provide attributes repeatedly used in the Entries or 
EntryTbls in the Rows of the TGroup that is
nested within the THead, TFoot, or TBody in which the  
SpanSpec occurs.  
</PARA>
<PARA>The reason Colname is used rather than Colnum 
in identifying 
SpanSpec is that the names are independent of revisions that 
may change the number of inserted/deleted columns, as  
long as Namest remains to the left of (has a smaller colnum 
than) Nameend.  SpanSpecs set on THead or TFoot override 
those on the containing TGroup and apply to just the THead 
or TFoot.  SpanSpecs from the containing TGroup apply to  
TBody. 
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Align</EMPHASIS> controls the horizontal position 
of text within the column.  
The value of Align may be Left (quad flush left), 
Center (centered), Right (quad flush right), 
Justify (both quad left and right), or Char (align to the
left of Char, positioned by Charoff).  The default
is Center. 
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Char</EMPHASIS> contributes to Align.  If the
value of Align is &ldquo;char&rdquo;, the value of Char
should be a character on the first occurrance
of which the entry is to be aligned.  If that 
character does not occur in the entry, the entry 
is aligned to the left of the position determined
by Charoff.  The default is inherited
from the ColSpec of the column named by Namest.
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Charoff</EMPHASIS> contributes with Char to Align.
Charoff is the proportion
of the current column width, expressed in percentage,
to be allowed before the left edge of the first occurrence
of the character given as the value of Char, if any.
The default is inherited from the ColSpec of 
the column named by Namest.
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Colsep</EMPHASIS> determines column separators.  If its value
is Yes, display the internal column rulings to 
the right of each item; if No, do not 
display it.  It is ignored for the last column, where the 
Frame setting applies.  (In CALS, 
Yes is expressed as 1 and No as 0.) 
The default is inherited from the ColSpec of
the column named by Namest.  
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Nameend</EMPHASIS> is the name of the rightmost 
column of the span.  Names are identified in the
Colspec of the current TGroup. 
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Namest</EMPHASIS> or Name Start, 
is the name of the leftmost column 
of the span.  Names are identified in the
Colspec of the current TGroup.  
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Rowsep</EMPHASIS> determines Row separators.  If its content is 
Yes, display the internal vertical Row ruling 
below each item; if No, do not display it.  It is 
ignored for the last Row of the table, where 
the frame value applies.  There is no default.
The value is inherited from the ColSpec of
the column named by Namest.

</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Colsep</EMPHASIS> determines column separators.  If its value
is Yes, display the internal column rulings to

value may be inherited from Tabstyle in the FOSI.  
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Frame</EMPHASIS> describes the positioning of

<PARA><EMPHASIS>Orient</EMPHASIS> determines the orientation of the
Table.  The allowed values are Port (the orientation
of the rest of the text of the Book, that is, upright)
and Land (90 degrees counterclockwise from the
orientation of the rest of the text of the Book).  
If you assume that the page is taller than
it is wide, tables that take up a whole page and

There is no default, the value may be 
inherited from the FOSI.
</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS>Pgwide</EMPHASIS> constrains the table to

Orient is set to Land.
The value may be inherited from Tabstyle in

Each TGroup effectively identifies a new 
portion of a Table.  If a new ColSpec is provided, it
replaces a previous one.  If both ColSpec and SpanSpec 
are new, that SpanSpec should refer to columns in the most 
recent ColSpec.  If only a new SpanSpec is provided, it 
should refer to columns defined by the most immediately 
prior ColSpecs in a TGroup of the
