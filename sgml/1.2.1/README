README

This directory contains several versions of the DocBook DTD,
their documentation, an SGML declaration, and some sample files.  
As of 13 March 1993 two versions of this DTD are available, 1.0 
(for historical reference) and 1.2.1 (the current version).  
The documentation for DTD version 1.0 is out of date, 
but may still be useful, especially for RefEntries (man pages).  

As of 13 March 1993 the documentation for the DTD version 1.2.1 
consists of an alphabetical list of elements, with definitions.  
This list is available in both PostScript and SGML formats.
Additional documentation will be forthcoming.  

DocBook 1.2 was an expanded and revised version of 1.0, including 
many in-line elements, some specific, some general and inclusive.  
Valid documents may of course be constructed with a subset of
these in-line elements---don't feel you must use them all.

DocBook 1.2.1 merely fixes some errors and omissions in 1.2 (see
the list below).

The DTD does not establish detailed rules for the usage of 
elements.  This is a matter for editors and writers to deal with.

Please note that the DTD has an associated SGML declaration,
also to be found in this directory.

To get all of the files relevant to version 1.2.1, obtain the files
named docbook1.2.1.shar, docbook.ps.Z, and docbook1.2.1.doc.ps.Z.


***  CHANGES in 1.2.1

The version number in the public identifier for the DTD was corrected
	and incremented (was 1.1.1, should have been 1.2, now is 1.2.1).

Semicolons missing from some parameter entities have been supplied.

BookAcronym, Holder, Revision, RevNumber, RevRemark, AuthorInitials, 
	Year, Firstname, and Surname have been removed from 
	docinfo.content.gp, as they may occur only within other 
	elements already in this parameter entity.

OtherAuthor should have been OtherName, and now is.  OtherName is an
	alternative to Firstname and (or) Surname in Author or Editor.

The HasRefentry attribute has been removed from the Primary, Secondary,
	etc. index elements.

FORMAL has been set to YES in the SGML declaration.

Several errors in the file docbook1.2.doc.sgml have been corrected,
	and an external entity file has been provided for it (ORAents.v3m).

Part has been allowed in Book, where it had been omitted by mistake.
	Suggestions for improving the Book model are invited (the addition
	of a Body element has been suggested).  Particularly interesting
	would be examples of real books that can't be represented 
	in this model.

The DOCTYPE line has been deleted from the sample man page.
