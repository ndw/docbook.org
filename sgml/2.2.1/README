README

This directory contains the current version of the DocBook DTD,
its documentation, an SGML declaration, an SGML Open-style 
entity catalogue, and some sample files.  

As of 25 February 1995 the latest revision of the DTD is version 2.2.1.
The previous version, 2.1, may be found in the subdirectory
"docbook.2.1".

As of 25 December 1995 the documentation for the DTD version 2.2.1
consists of a "Guide" that includes an alphabetical list of 
elements, with definitions, in both SGML and PostScript.  A sample 
Chapter and sample RefEntry (man page) are also provided.
The entity file "orathree" contains local entities
for use with these examples.

DocBook 2.2.1 is an expanded and revised version of 2.1
Instances conforming to 2.1 may require some changes
to conform to 2.2.1 (see the Guide for a list of changes in
the DTD).

More documentation may be made available as time permits.  Suggestions
for improving the documentation are welcome.

The DTD does not establish detailed rules for the usage of 
elements.  This is a matter for editors and writers to deal with.

Please note that the DTD has an associated SGML declaration.

To get all of the files relevant to version 2.2.1, obtain the files
named docbook.2.2.1.shar and docbook.ps.Z.
