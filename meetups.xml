<para>The DocBook Technical Committee is considering holding a one day
workshop/conference/meetup, call it what you like, on Friday, 10
February in Prague, CZ colocated with the <link xlink:href="http://xmlprague.cz/">XML
Prague</link> conference.</para>

<para>We haven't really worked out any of the details yet, but there
are lots of possibilities. In no particular order:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>What's new in DocBook 5.1?</para>

<listitem>
<para>DocBook for topic-oriented authoring (topics and assemblies in DocBook)</para>

<para>Customizing and extending DocBook: markup and tools</para>

<listitem>
<para><replaceable>Insert your favorite topic here</replaceable></para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>We realize that Prague is kind of a hike for users outside of
Europe, but in fairness, anywhere we pick is a hike for someone. And
as I've burbled effusively about the XML Prague conference before, I
assure you that it's worth the trip.</para>

<para>So, if we do it, will you come? And if you will, what topics
would you like on the agenda and would you like to present on
something you've been working on?</para>
