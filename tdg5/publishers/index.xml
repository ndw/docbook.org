<para><citetitle>DocBook Publishers:
The Definitive Guide</citetitle> is a special edition of
<link xlink:href="/tdg5/">DocBook: The Definitive Guide</link> designed
especially to cover the <link xlink:href="/schemas/pub5x">Publishers Schema</link>.</para>

<para>This is an early, experimental version. The elements and content models
are correct, the descriptions are (mostly) correct. But the prose is still
quite incomplete. Also, there are known formatting and linking problems.
